# Project Progress

## What Works

- **Project Initialization**: The project has been set up with Next.js 15+, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Memory Bank**: Complete documentation structure is established for tracking project status and decisions.
- **Database Schema**: All core tables created and migrated.
- **Supabase Auth SSR**: Foundational client, server, and middleware files are in place, and a basic authentication flow (signup, login, logout) is functional.
- **Shared TypeScript Types**: `lib/types/index.ts` created and populated with core data interfaces.
- **Core API Endpoints (CRUD)**:
  - [x] Projects API (`app/api/projects/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/`)
  - [x] Chapters API (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/chapters/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/chapters/[chapterId]/`)
  - [x] Scenes API (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/chapters/[chapterId]/scenes/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/chapters/[chapterId]/scenes/[sceneId]/`)
  - [x] Characters API (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/characters/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/characters/[characterId]/`)
  - [x] World Building Notes API (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/world-notes/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/world-notes/[noteId]/`)
  - [x] Outline Items API (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/outline-items/` and `app/api/projects/[projectId]/outline-items/[itemId]/`)
- **Zod Schemas**: Validation schemas created for all core entities.
- **Homepage Functionality**:
  - [x] Display existing projects for the logged-in user.
  - [x] Allow creation of new projects via a modal.
- **Project Dashboard - Manuscript Section**:
  - [x] Dynamically fetch and list chapters for a project.
  - [x] Add new chapters via `CreateChapterModal.tsx`.
  - [x] On chapter selection, dynamically fetch and list scenes for that chapter.
  - [x] Add new scenes to a chapter via `CreateSceneModal.tsx`.
  - [x] Data fetching functions in `lib/data/chapters.ts` and `lib/data/scenes.ts`.
- **Next.js 15 Asynchronous API Compatibility**:
  - [x] Updated `app/(dashboard)/project/[projectId]/page.tsx` to use `await params`.
  - [x] Updated `lib/data/projects.ts` to use `await cookies()`.
  - [x] Updated API route handlers (`app/api/projects/[projectId]/route.ts`, `app/api/projects/[projectId]/chapters/route.ts`) to use `await params`.

## Current Status

**Phase**: Core Application Views -> **Manuscript Feature Complete, Focusing on Dashboard Navigation**
_(Updated: 2025-05-10)_

The project has successfully established its foundational API layer, a basic authentication flow, and a functional homepage. The manuscript section of the project dashboard now allows users to list chapters, add new chapters, select a chapter to view its scenes, add new scenes, and edit scene content using the `ManuscriptEditor`. Scene content auto-saves, and word counts are updated dynamically. Compatibility issues with Next.js 15's asynchronous dynamic APIs have been addressed.

The immediate focus areas are now:

1.  **Dashboard Navigation**: Fully implementing navigation between different project sections (Outline, Characters, etc.).
2.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Improving chapter/scene metadata display and auth feedback.
3.  **Authentication UI Refinements**: Enhancing error handling and user feedback for auth flows.

## Known Issues

- No major known issues, but client-side error handling and user feedback for auth and project creation can be improved.
- Scene/word counts for chapters are not yet displayed in the chapter list.

| 2025-05-10 | Implemented dynamic chapter and scene fetching in `ProjectDashboardClient` | To make the manuscript section self-contained for its data needs and reflect real-time additions.   |
| 2025-05-10 | Created `CreateChapterModal` and `CreateSceneModal` components             | To provide UI for adding new chapters and scenes.                                                   |
| 2025-05-10 | Updated `ListSectionHeader` to support an `actionElement` prop             | To allow placement of action buttons (like "add") directly in section headers, matching UI mockups. |
| 2025-05-10 | Addressed Next.js 15 async API requirements                                | Ensured `params` and `cookies()` are `await`ed in server contexts to prevent runtime errors.        |
| 2025-05-10 | Integrated `ManuscriptEditor` into `ProjectDashboardClient`                | Enabled scene content editing, auto-saving, and dynamic word count updates. Used `geistSans` font.  |
