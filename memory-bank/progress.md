# Project Progress

_(Updated: 2025-05-26 (AI-Generated Update))_

## What Works

- **World Notes Static Viewer & Edit Toggle (2025-05-26):**

  - The World Notes section now displays notes in a static, Markdown-rendered view by default, with an "Edit" button to switch to the editor.
  - View/edit state is managed in `useWorldNotesData` with new state and handlers.
  - The new `WorldNoteViewer` component provides a clean, readable Markdown display, visually distinct from the editor.
  - The main section conditionally renders the viewer or editor, ensuring seamless transitions and correct state resets on selection or deletion.
  - The editor now supports a "Cancel" button and improved save/cancel flow.
  - All flows (view, edit, create, delete, edge cases) have been tested for correctness and UX clarity.
  - This pattern may be extended to other note-like features for improved consistency.

- **Major Project Dashboard Refactor (2025-05-26):**

  - The dashboard is now fully modular: each section (Manuscript, Outline, Characters, World Notes) is implemented as a self-contained component in `components/dashboard/sections/`, using its own custom data hook in `hooks/dashboard/`.
  - Shared project-wide data (e.g., all characters, all scene tags) is managed by `ProjectDataContext`, providing context and hooks to all sections.
  - All state, effects, and handlers have been removed from `ProjectDashboardClient.tsx`, which now simply renders the section components and provides context.
  - All modals and detail panels are managed within their respective section components.
  - The new structure enables easier testing, maintenance, and future feature development.
  - Comprehensive cleanup and bugfixes: removed unused variables/imports, fixed all TypeScript errors, audited all `useEffect`/`useCallback` dependencies, and verified all import paths.
  - Fixed key bugs: infinite character query loop in OutlineSection, real-time word count update in `AppHeader`, and optional character image handling in `CreateCharacterModal`.
  - All dashboard sections and flows have been tested for CRUD, navigation, and data consistency.

## What's Left to Build

### Core Infrastructure

- [ ] Authentication System:
  - [ ] Refined error handling and user feedback (e.g., consistent `sonner` toasts for all auth actions).
- [ ] User Profile Management:
  - [ ] UI for users to view/edit their profile information.
  - [ ] UI for changing password (distinct from password reset).

### Main Features

- [ ] Project Management (Client-Side):
  - [x] Project editing interface (e.g., update title, genre, target word count).
  - [x] Project deletion confirmation and functionality from homepage/dashboard.
- [ ] Outlines (Client-Side Enhancements):
  - [ ] More robust editing experience within `ChapterSceneOutlineList.tsx` (e.g., inline editing or more comprehensive modals for all scene outline fields).
  - [ ] UI for reordering scenes within chapters, and chapters within the project.
  - [ ] UI to fully demonstrate/facilitate the Snowflake method (if specific UI beyond synopsis fields is needed).
- [ ] World Building & Research Notes (Enhancements):
  - [x] Static Markdown viewer and edit toggle for World Notes.
  - [ ] Advanced Notes organization UI (e.g., filtering/searching by category).
  - [ ] Linking notes to specific manuscript scenes or characters.
- [ ] Export Functionality:
  - [ ] Implement project export (e.g., as a manuscript format).
- [ ] Scene Tag System:
  - [ ] Finalize dedicated tag management UI and API routes.
  - [ ] Comprehensive testing and UX refinement for the new two-tiered tag system.

### AI Features

- [ ] AI Service Integration:
  - [ ] Token tracking and usage limits per user (requires backend and UI).
- [ ] Specific AI Tools Implementation:
  - [x] **Snowflake Log Line Outliner**: Integrate AI to assist with one-sentence synopses based on user input or existing project content. (Log line generation refactored to background modality).
  - [x] **Snowflake Synopsis Outliner**: Integrate AI to assist with one-page synopses based on user input or existing project content.
  - [ ] **Snowflake Scene Outliner**: Integrate AI to assist with generating a summary of the scene based on the scene text.
  - [ ] **Character Enhancer**: Develop prompts and UI for AI to help flesh out characters.
  - [ ] **Research Assistant**: Tool for AI-powered research within the app.
  - [ ] **Plot Assistant**: Tools for identifying plot holes, brainstorming plot points.
  - [ ] **Writing Coach**: AI feedback on writing style, prose.
  - [ ] **Editor Assistant**: AI suggestions for tightening prose (respecting "AI never writes final text" principle).
- [ ] AI Settings Expansion:
  - [ ] UI in `SiteSettingsClient.tsx` for managing AI Prompts (CRUD), potentially with categorization.

### Deployment & DevOps

- [ ] Docker Setup (Development and Production).
- [ ] CI/CD Pipeline (Testing, Build, Deployment).
- [ ] Fly.io Deployment (Configuration, Domain, SSL).

## Current Status

### Outline Creator (2025-05-29)

âœ… JSON structure and interfaces  
âœ… System prompt configuration  
âœ… Backend logic for AI interaction  
âœ… Entity creation from outline  
âœ… Basic UI implementation  
âœ… Initial testing  
ðŸ”§ Additional testing and refinements

## Current Status

**Phase**: Foundational AI Integration & Outline UI Implemented -> **Focusing on Expanding Specific AI Tools, Completing Outline/Settings UI, Scene Tag System Overhaul, and AI Prompts Management**

The project has a robust backend API, a functional authentication system, and a well-structured frontend with key dashboard sections (Manuscript, Characters, World Notes, basic Outline, AI Model, Vendor & Prompt Settings) implemented. `snowgander` is integrated for AI calls, and the log line generation feature now operates in a background modality. The "Edit Project Details" modal has been successfully implemented, allowing users to update core project information.

The immediate focus areas are:

1.  **Flesh out AI Tools**: Implement specific AI assistance features (beyond log line generation) using the established `AISidePanel` and `AIToolButton` pattern, leveraging `tool_model` and `ai_prompts`.
2.  **Complete Outline UI**: Enhance the scene outline editing capabilities and consider chapter/scene reordering.
3.  **Complete AI Settings UI**: Add management for AI Prompts.
4.  **Scene Tag System**: Finalize and test the new two-tiered tag system (primary category + global tags), including dedicated tag management UI/API and comprehensive UX testing.
5.  **User Profile Management**: Basic profile page.
6.  **Refine UX & Error Handling**: Improve user feedback across the application.

## Known Issues

- Client-side error handling for some data operations could be more robust with `sonner` toasts.
- Full word count aggregation for chapters/project is present in API responses but might need more prominent UI display beyond `AppHeader`.
- AI Tool specific system prompts need to be created and managed.
- The UI needs a lot of refinement and polish.

### Bugs

- [Fixed 2025-05-26] When no characters exist in a project, the app kept querying characters over and over non-stop when on the outline page (OutlineSection infinite query loop). **Resolved by tracking fetch attempts per project.**
- [Fixed 2025-05-26] The total project word count did not get updated in real time, only after a refresh. **Resolved by calling `router.refresh()` after scene edits.**
- [Fixed 2025-05-26] The optional character image was incorrectly set up as required. **Resolved by handling `image_url` as nullable/optional in `CreateCharacterModal`.**
