# Product Context

## Purpose & Mission

Snowscribe is a novelwriting application that leverages AI throughout the creative process while ensuring human authors retain full creative control and authorship. The application aims to solve the problem where current AI writing tools take over too much of the writing process, while still providing powerful AI assistance for brainstorming, outlining, editing, researching, and plot development.

## Core Problem

Many current AI writing tools are built around AI generating the final text, removing human creativity and authorship from the process. Snowscribe believes that while AI is an excellent tool for supporting the writing process, humans should remain the actual authors of their novels.

## User Experience Goals

- Beautiful typography that enhances readability and aesthetics
- Clean, intuitive, modern, and polished interface that is uncluttered
- Mobile responsiveness is absolutely required
- Accessibility compliance with modern web standards
- Delightful user experience that makes the writing process enjoyable

## Key Features

### Organization

- Project > Chapters > Scenes (manuscript text) structure
- Character cards to organize character information
- World building/research notes section
- Outlining tools using the snowflake method
- Project information (title, genre, word count, goals)
- Scene tagging and character tracking
- Filtering and reporting capabilities

### AI Integration

- AI features accessible throughout but can fade into background when not needed
- Specialized AI tools for specific writing tasks
- AI never generates the final manuscript text

### Outlining Feature

- Allows the user to write a one sentence synopsis (Snowflake method)
- Allows the user to write a one page synopsis (Snowflake method)
- Allows the user to create a list of scenes with:
  - A very brief description
  - The POV character (links to one of the project's Characters)
  - Other characters (links to one or more of the project's Characters)
  - Scene tag(s) for a uniform way of describing what type of scene it is.
- Scenes can be grouped into chapters
- These scenes and chapters are the same objects as the scenes and chapters in the manuscript.
- A common workflow is that a user creates their outline and the chapter and scenes are there waiting for them in the manuscript section just waiting to be written.
- Another workflow is that a user can start writing their novel in the manuscript section and the outline section is automatically populated (because they share chapter and scene records). In this case, the scene descriptions will be blank but the user can populate manually or use AI to generate descriptions from the manusctript text.
- A hybrid workflow works too since the two sections share records. A user can start with an incomplete outline, expand through the manuscript section, then use the outline section to refine.

## Business Model

- Freemium subscription model
