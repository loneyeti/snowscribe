# Product Context

## Purpose & Mission

Snowscribe is a novelwriting application that leverages AI throughout the creative process while ensuring human authors retain full creative control and authorship. The application aims to solve the problem where current AI writing tools take over too much of the writing process, while still providing powerful AI assistance for brainstorming, outlining, editing, researching, and plot development.

## Core Problem

Many current AI writing tools are built around AI generating the final text, removing human creativity and authorship from the process. Snowscribe believes that while AI is an excellent tool for supporting the writing process, humans should remain the actual authors of their novels.
